Task to do.

Before doing this task you will need to install Microsoft SQL Server 2019 Express. 
You have to create two databases- Source db and Dest db. Afterwards you should 
execute two scripts containing source data to feed Source database. Second script 
contains dml for Dest database.

Description
Create a script to migrate data from Source db to Dest db. Source database contains 
data from medium sized law firm from Mexico. Both databases store data about legal
cases in tables: cases and CaseTable. Source db stores list of documents in table:
case_document_list and each document is described by using the following attributes: 
Date Added, Category, Notes, File Path. Glossary is in user_doc_fields.

Above mentioned script should migrate data in the following categories:
-correspondence
-medical request
-notice letters
-settlement negotiations
->to Dest db ->to table Correspondence.

Here you can find maping 
Dest------------------Source
Description-----------Notes
Data------------------Date Added
Link------------------File Path

Cases in both databases are referenced one to each other
with alt_case_num in Source db and [File #] in Dest db.
In Dest db paths to files are in the following format:
<file_name>#<full_file_path>
e.g  c:\test.pdf path will be: Test.pdf#c:\test.pdf

The script you should prepare shouldn't duplicate data during subsequent executions.
Good luck and regards from Italy :) Francesco
